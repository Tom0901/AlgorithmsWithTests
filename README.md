# DataSturcturesWithTests

While attempting to improve my knowledge of computer science fundamentals by solving toy problems I thought it would also be a good opportunity to write some tests using Jest. The clear inputs, outputs and scale of these problems means that they have been a perfect exercise for improving my knowledge of TDD. I've also been able to get some really nice efficiency gains from the tests themselves. 

Below, are some breif explanations of the toy problems I have chosen to tackle as well as some info on my chosen approach to solve the problem and how that has impacted the time of space efficiency of the algorithm.
